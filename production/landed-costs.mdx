---

## Sample vs Production Landed Cost

| Aspect | Sample | Production |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Location** | Sample Detail page | Production Order Detail page |
| **Labor rates** | 2 (stitcher, fuser) | 5 (cutter, fuser, stitcher, finisher, packing) |
| **Quantity** | Small (1-5 typically) | Large (50-5000+) |
| **Materials calculation** | Per sample | Per unit × total quantity |
| **Purpose** | Estimate costs | Track actual production costs |

## Cost Breakdown

### Line-by-Line Explanation

| Line | What It Shows | Calculation |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Materials** | Total material cost | (Leather + Accessories + Lining) × Quantity |
| **Cutting** | Total cutting labor | cutter_rate × Quantity |
| **Fusing** | Total fusing labor | fuser_rate × Quantity |
| **Stitching** | Total stitching labor | stitcher_rate × Quantity |
| **Finishing** | Total finishing labor | finisher_rate × Quantity |
| **Packing** | Total packing labor | packing_rate × Quantity |
| **Additional** | Other costs | Manual entry |
| **Total Cost** | Everything combined | Materials + All Labor + Additional |
| **Per Unit** | Cost per piece | Total ÷ Quantity |

---

## Materials Cost

Materials cost is calculated from the linked sample (if created from sample) or entered manually:

```
Materials Cost = (Leather + Accessories + Lining) × Total Quantity
```

**Example:**
| Material | Unit Cost | Quantity | Total |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Leather | PKR 500 | 200 | PKR 100,000 |
| Accessories | PKR 150 | 200 | PKR 30,000 |
| Lining | PKR 80 | 200 | PKR 16,000 |
| **Materials Total** | | | **PKR 146,000** |

---

## Labor Costs (All 5 Stages)

Each labor cost = Rate × Total Quantity

| Stage | Rate Field | Example Rate | Quantity | Total |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------|-------|
| Cutting | cutter_rate | PKR 50 | 200 | PKR 10,000 |
| Fusing | fuser_rate | PKR 30 | 200 | PKR 6,000 |
| Stitching | stitcher_rate | PKR 150 | 200 | PKR 30,000 |
| Finishing | finisher_rate | PKR 80 | 200 | PKR 16,000 |
| Packing | packing_rate | PKR 40 | 200 | PKR 8,000 |
| **Labor Total** | | | | **PKR 70,000** |

<Info>
Labor costs are calculated from the rates set on the production order, not actual completed work. The landed cost shows the expected total cost if all units are completed.
</Info>

## Additional Costs

You can add other costs manually:

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Packaging materials | Boxes, tissue, tags |
| Special treatments | Waterproofing, embossing |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Materials cost showing as 0">
    **Cause:** Material costs not entered on sample, or production order created manually without material costs.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check linked sample has material costs entered
    2. Or edit production order to enter material costs manually
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Labor costs showing as 0">
    **Cause:** Rate fields are set to 0.

    **Solution:** Edit production order → Enter rates for all 5 stages → Save.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Per unit cost seems wrong">
    **Cause:** Quantity is incorrect, or costs are missing.

    **Solution:**
    1. Verify total quantity is correct
    2. Check all cost lines have values
    3. Recalculate: Total ÷ Quantity = Per Unit
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GBP conversion looks wrong">
    **Cause:** Exchange rate may be outdated or incorrect.

    **Solution:** Exchange rate updates automatically. If still wrong, contact admin to verify rate source.
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't edit landed cost">
    **Cause:** Values are calculated from other fields.

    **Solution:** Edit the source fields:
    - Materials: Edit on linked sample or production order
    - Labor: Edit rate fields on production order
    - Additional: Add/edit in Additional Costs section
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
