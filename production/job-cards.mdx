# Job Cards

A job card represents **one physical piece** being manufactured. If a production order has 500 units, there are 500 job cards.

## Job Card Number Format

**Format:** `JC-YYYY-XXXXX`

| Part | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `JC` | Job Card prefix | JC |
| `YYYY` | Year created | 2026 |
| `XXXXX` | Sequential number (5 digits) | 00001, 00142, 01500 |

**Example:** `JC-2026-00142` = The 142nd job card created in 2026

## How Job Cards Are Created

Job cards are created **automatically** when you create a production order.

| Production Order Quantity | Job Cards Created |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 50 units | 50 job cards |
| 200 units | 200 job cards |
| 1,000 units | 1,000 job cards |

<Info>
You cannot manually create individual job cards. They are always generated from a production order.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Job cards not appearing after creating order">
    **Cause:** Page not refreshed, or quantity was 0.

    **Solution:** Refresh the page. Check production order quantities are greater than 0.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot change stage">
    **Cause:** Trying to skip stages, or job card already completed.

    **Solution:** Stages must progress in order. Check current stage and select the next one only.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong worker assigned">
    **Cause:** Selected wrong worker during stage change.

    **Solution:** Stage changes cannot be undone. Contact admin if correction needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bulk action not working">
    **Cause:** Selected job cards are at different stages.

    **Solution:** Only select job cards that are at the same current stage for bulk updates.
