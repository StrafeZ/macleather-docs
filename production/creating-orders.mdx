# Creating Production Orders

There are two ways to create a production order:
1. **From a sample** — Click "Move to Production" on an approved sample
2. **Manual** — Create directly in the Production module

    Button in sample header (only visible when all materials approved)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter production details">

<Info>
The system creates one job card per unit. If you enter 135 total units, the system creates 135 job cards.

## What the System Creates

When you click Create, the system:

1. **Generates production order number** (PRD-YYYY-XXX)
2. **Creates job cards** — One per unit (e.g., 135 units = 135 job cards)
3. **Assigns job card numbers** — Sequential (JC-YYYY-XXXXX)
4. **Sets all job cards to "Created" stage**
5. **Sets production order to "New" status**
6. **Links to source sample** (if created from sample)
7. **Logs creation in Activity tab**
8. **Redirects to Production Order Detail page**
