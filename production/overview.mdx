# Production Overview

The Production module manages bulk manufacturing orders. Each production order contains multiple job cards—one for each physical piece being made.

## System Codes

### Production Order

**Format:** `PRD-YYYY-XXX`

| Part | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `PRD` | Production prefix | PRD |
| `YYYY` | Year created | 2026 |
| `XXX` | Sequential number | 001, 002, 003... |

**Example:** `PRD-2026-015` = The 15th production order created in 2026

### Job Card

**Format:** `JC-YYYY-XXXXX`

| Part | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `JC` | Job Card prefix | JC |
| `YYYY` | Year created | 2026 |
| `XXXXX` | Sequential number (5 digits) | 00001, 00142 |

**Example:** `JC-2026-00142` = The 142nd job card created in 2026

<Info>
Job cards have 5-digit sequential numbers because there are many more job cards than production orders. A single production order of 500 units creates 500 job cards.
