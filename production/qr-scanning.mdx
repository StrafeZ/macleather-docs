| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Stage tracking | Update job card from one stage to the next |

## Scanning QR Codes

### What Happens When Scanned

When a worker scans a QR code:

1. **System identifies job card** — Reads JC number from QR
2. **Worker selects their name** — From dropdown or pre-logged in
3. **Stage advances** — Moves to next stage automatically
4. **Record created** — Logs worker, timestamp, stage
5. **Payment calculated** — Rate for that stage added to worker's earnings

### Scan Flow Example

| Current Stage | After Scan | Worker Recorded | Payment Added |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Created | Cutting | Cutter name | cutter_rate |
| Cutting | Fusing | Fuser name | fuser_rate |
| Fusing | Stitching | Stitcher name | stitcher_rate |
| Stitching | Finishing | Finisher name | finisher_rate |
| Finishing | Packing | Packer name | packing_rate |
| Packing | Completed | Packer name | — |

<Info>
Each scan advances the job card by one stage. Workers can only scan cards that are ready for their department's stage.

## Scanner Setup

### Supported Devices

- Dedicated barcode/QR scanners
- Smartphones with camera
- Tablets with camera

### Scanner App

Workers use the Mac Leather Dashboard mobile app or web scanner:

**Location:** App → **Scan** tab

Or access web scanner at: `app.macleather.co.uk/scan`

---

## What the System Records

Each scan creates a record with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Job Card | JC number scanned |
| Stage | Stage completed |
| Worker | Worker who scanned |
| Timestamp | Date and time of scan |
| Rate | Rate applied for this stage |
| Production Order | Parent PRD number |

---

## Payment Calculation

When a worker scans a job card:

```
Payment = Rate for that stage × 1 piece
```

**Example:**
- Worker scans job card at Stitching stage
- Stitcher rate = PKR 150
- Worker earns PKR 150 for that piece

Worker's total earnings = Sum of all pieces completed × rate per piece

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="QR code won't scan">
    **Possible causes:**
    - QR code damaged or dirty
    - Poor lighting
    - Camera not focused

    **Solutions:**
    - Clean the QR label
    - Improve lighting
    - Hold scanner steady, closer to QR code
    - Reprint QR code if damaged
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Job card not found' error">
    **Cause:** QR code is corrupted or job card was deleted.

    **Solution:** Search for job card manually by number. If not found, contact admin.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Wrong stage' error">
    **Cause:** Job card is not at the expected stage for this worker's department.

    **Solution:** Check job card's current stage. A Stitcher cannot scan a card that's still at Cutting stage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Already completed' error">
    **Cause:** Job card has already been scanned for this stage.

    **Solution:** This job card already moved past this stage. No action needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Worker not appearing in dropdown">
    **Cause:** Worker not added to system or not assigned to correct department.

    **Solution:** Contact admin to add worker or update their department.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payment not showing for worker">
    **Cause:** Rate is set to 0, or scan didn't complete.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check production order rates (Rate Management)
    2. Verify scan completed (check job card stage history)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scanned wrong job card">
    **Cause:** Human error.
