# Rate Management

Rates determine how much workers are paid per piece at each production stage. Rates are set on the production order and apply to all job cards within that order.

---

## Rate Fields

| Field | Stage | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `cutter_rate` | Cutting | Payment per piece for cutting |
| `fuser_rate` | Fusing | Payment per piece for fusing |
| `stitcher_rate` | Stitching | Payment per piece for stitching |
| `finisher_rate` | Finishing | Payment per piece for finishing |
| `packing_rate` | Packing | Payment per piece for packing |

All rates are in **PKR** (Pakistani Rupees).

---

## Where Rates Come From

Rates flow through the system in this order:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Sample] --> B[Production Order]
    B --> C[Job Cards]
```

| Source | Destination | How |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Sample | Production Order | Copied when using "Move to Production" |
| Production Order | Job Cards | Applied when job card stage is completed |

<Info>
If you create a production order manually (not from a sample), rates start at 0. You must enter them on the production order.
</Info>

## Effect on Existing Job Cards

When you update rates on a production order:

| Job Card Status | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| Not yet at that stage | **New rate applies** when they reach the stage |
| Already completed that stage | **No change** — original rate was already recorded |

**Example:**
- Production order has stitcher_rate = PKR 100
- 50 job cards already completed Stitching (paid PKR 100 each)
- You change stitcher_rate to PKR 120
- Remaining 150 job cards will be paid PKR 120 when they complete Stitching
- The 50 already completed remain at PKR 100

<Warning>
Rate changes only affect job cards that haven't completed that stage yet. Completed stages keep their original rate.
</Warning>

## How Worker Payment Is Calculated

When a worker completes a stage (via QR scan or manual update):

```
Payment = Rate for that stage × 1 piece
```

### Example Calculation

| Stage | Worker | Rate | Payment |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Cutting | Ali | PKR 50 | PKR 50 |
| Fusing | Bilal | PKR 30 | PKR 30 |
| Stitching | Fatima | PKR 150 | PKR 150 |
| Finishing | Hassan | PKR 80 | PKR 80 |
| Packing | Zara | PKR 40 | PKR 40 |

### Worker Total Earnings

Worker earnings = Sum of all pieces completed × rate per piece

**Example:** Fatima completes Stitching on 100 job cards at PKR 150 each = PKR 15,000

---

## Rate Inheritance

### From Sample to Production

When you click "Move to Production" on a sample:

| Sample Field | Production Field |
|--------------|------------------|
| stitcher_rate | stitcher_rate |
| fuser_rate | fuser_rate |

<Info>
Samples only have stitcher_rate and fuser_rate. The other three rates (cutter, finisher, packing) must be set on the production order.
</Info>

### Default Values

| Field | Default if Not Set |
|-------|-------------------|
| cutter_rate | 0 |
| fuser_rate | From sample, or 0 |
| stitcher_rate | From sample, or 0 |
| finisher_rate | 0 |
| packing_rate | 0 |

<Warning>
If a rate is 0, workers will not earn anything for completing that stage. Always verify rates before production starts.
</Warning>

## Common Scenarios

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Set rates for new order | Production Order → Edit → Enter all 5 rates → Save |
| Check current rates | Production Order → Overview tab → Rates section |
| Change rate mid-production | Production Order → Edit → Update rate → Save (only affects future completions) |
| Rate showing as 0 | Edit production order and enter the correct rate |
| Verify worker will be paid | Check that rate for their stage is greater than 0 |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Worker not getting paid for completed work">
    **Cause:** Rate is set to 0 for that stage.

    **Solution:** Edit production order → Set correct rate → Save. Note: This won't retroactively pay for already-completed stages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rates didn't copy from sample">
    **Cause:** Sample didn't have rates set, or created production order manually.

    **Solution:** Edit production order and enter rates manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong rate applied to job cards">
    **Cause:** Rate was changed after some job cards completed.

    **Solution:** Completed stages cannot be changed. For future job cards, update the rate on production order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't edit rates">
    **Cause:** Don't have edit permission, or order is completed/cancelled.

    **Solution:** Contact admin for permission, or rates cannot be changed on completed orders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
