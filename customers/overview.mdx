## When Customer Not Listed

If the customer doesn't have a specific guide:

1. Check [Generic Requirements](/customers/generic) for safe defaults
2. Ask customer for their compliance guide
3. Contact your supervisor for guidance
4. When in doubt, use conservative specifications (lighter weights, clearer labels)
