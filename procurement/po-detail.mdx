## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't edit PO">
    **Cause:** PO is in Pending Approval or Approved status.

    **Solution:** You can only edit when status is Draft or Rejected. If Pending, wait for approval decision or ask approver to reject so you can edit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Approve button not showing">
    **Cause:** You don't have approval permissions, or PO is not pending.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check PO status is "Pending Approval"
    2. Verify you have approval permissions for this amount
    3. Contact admin if you should have approval rights
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PO over my approval limit">
    **Cause:** Total amount exceeds your authorization limit.

    **Solution:** A higher-level approver is needed. Check the Approval section to see who can approve this amount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Submit button not showing">
    **Cause:** PO is not in Draft status, or missing required fields.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check status is Draft
    2. Ensure all required fields are filled
    3. Ensure at least one item is added
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't delete PO">
    **Cause:** PO is not in Draft status.

    **Solution:** Only Draft POs can be deleted. Once submitted, POs are permanent records.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Items showing wrong total">
    **Cause:** Calculation not refreshed.

    **Solution:** Refresh page. Total = Sum of (Quantity × Unit Rate) for all items.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Linked sample not showing">
    **Cause:** PO was created manually, not from a sample.

    **Solution:** Manual POs don't auto-link. The link is only created when PO is generated from a sample's material section.
  </Accordion>
