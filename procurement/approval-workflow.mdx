# Approval Workflow

Purchase orders require approval before they can proceed. This guide explains how approval limits work, how to submit POs for approval, and how approvers process requests.

---

## How Approval Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Draft] -->|Submit| B[Pending Approval]
    B -->|Approve| C[Approved]
    B -->|Reject| D[Rejected]
    D -->|Edit & Resubmit| B
```

1. Creator submits PO for approval
2. System routes to appropriate approver based on amount
3. Approver reviews and approves or rejects
4. If rejected, creator can edit and resubmit

---

## Approval Limits

Approvers are assigned authorization limits. A PO can only be approved by someone with a limit equal to or higher than the PO total.

### Example Limits

| Approver Role | Limit (PKR) | Can Approve |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Supervisor | Up to 50,000 | POs ≤ 50,000 |
| Manager | Up to 200,000 | POs ≤ 200,000 |
| Director | Up to 1,000,000 | POs ≤ 1,000,000 |
| Owner | Unlimited | Any amount |

<Info>
Approval limits are set by system administrators. Contact your admin if you need to check or update approval limits.
</Info>

### Checking Who Can Approve

**Location:** PO Detail → Approval section

The system shows:
- Required approval level for this PO amount
- Who can approve this PO
