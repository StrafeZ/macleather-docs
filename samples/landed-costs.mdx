# Sample Landed Costs

The Landed Cost module calculates the total cost to produce a sample, including materials, labor, and any additional expenses.

<Note>
**Where to find it**

Open any sample and look for the **Landed Cost** card on the sample detail page.
</Note>

## Cost Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Materials Cost">
    Automatically calculated from your three material entries:

    - **Leather** cost
    - **Accessories** cost
    - **Lining** cost

    Enter the cost for each material in its detail section. The total updates automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Labor Costs">
    Based on the rates you set on the sample:

    - **Stitcher Rate** × Quantity = Stitching cost
    - **Fuser Rate** × Quantity = Fusing cost

    For example: If stitcher rate is PKR 150 and quantity is 2, stitching cost = PKR 300.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Additional Costs">
    Optional extras you can add manually:

    - Packaging
    - Special finishing
    - Testing fees
    - Any other costs

    Click **Add Cost** to include additional line items.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Currency Display

Costs are shown in both currencies:

| Currency | Use |
|----------|-----|
| **PKR** | Local production costs, labor rates |
| **GBP** | Customer pricing, export invoicing |

<Info>
Exchange rates update automatically. The current rate is shown at the top of the Landed Cost card.
</Info>

## Per-Unit Cost

The system calculates the cost per unit:

```
Per-Unit Cost = Total Cost ÷ Quantity
```

This helps when quoting to customers or comparing sample costs across different products.

## FOB vs CIF

For samples, you'll typically work with:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **FOB** | Free On Board – cost to get the sample ready for shipping |
| **CIF** | Cost, Insurance & Freight – includes shipping to customer |

Most sample quotes are FOB. Full CIF calculations with freight, insurance, and duties are handled in the [Export Landed Costs](/exports/landed-costs) module for production orders.

## Labor Rates and Production

When you [convert a sample to production](/samples/sample-to-production), the stitcher and fuser rates carry over to the production order.

These rates then apply to job cards, determining worker pay for each unit produced.

<Tip>
Set accurate rates at the sample stage. It's easier to adjust now than after production has started.
