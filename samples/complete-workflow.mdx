# Sample Workflow Guide

This guide covers how to use Sample Flow Nexus to manage samples. It explains system codes, field definitions, status meanings, and step-by-step procedures.

---

## System Codes

### Sample Number Format

All samples are assigned an automatic number: **`SMP-YYYY-XXX`**

| Part | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `SMP` | Sample prefix | SMP |
| `YYYY` | Year created | 2026 |
| `XXX` | Sequential number (resets each year) | 001, 002, 003... |

**Example:** `SMP-2026-042` = The 42nd sample created in 2026

### Other System Codes

| Code | Record Type | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `SMP` | Sample | SMP-2026-001 |
| `PRD` | Production Order | PRD-2026-001 |
| `PO` | Purchase Order | PO-2026-001 |
| `JC` | Job Card | JC-2026-001 |

## Sample Statuses

### Status Reference

| Status | Meaning | How It's Set |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| New Sample | Sample created, no materials ordered | Automatic on creation |
| Procurement | At least one material is being ordered | Automatic when any material → "Ordered" |
| In House | All materials received and approved | Automatic when all 3 materials → "Approved" |
| Production | Sample is being manufactured | Manual |
| Inspection | Sample complete, undergoing QC | Manual |
| Ready to Ship | Passed QC, awaiting dispatch | Manual |
| Shipped | Sent to customer | Manual |
| On Hold | Paused | Manual |
| Delay | Behind schedule | Manual, or automatic if past delivery date |

### Automatic Status Changes

<Info>
**The system changes sample status automatically in these cases:**

1. When you change **any material** to "Ordered" → Sample becomes **"Procurement"**
2. When **all three materials** are "Approved" → Sample becomes **"In House"**

You don't need to manually update the sample status in these situations.

### Status Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Not Ordered] --> B[Ordered]
    B --> C[Started]
    C --> D[In Transit]
    D --> E[In House]
    E --> F[Approved]

    B -.-> G[Delay]
    C -.-> G
    D -.-> G

    E -.-> H[Sent Back]
    H -.-> B

    A -.-> I[On Hold]
