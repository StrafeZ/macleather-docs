# Converting Sample to Production

Once a customer approves a sample, convert it to a production order to begin manufacturing at scale.

## When to Convert

Convert a sample when:

- Customer has approved the sample
- Materials have been verified and sourced
- Pricing has been confirmed
- You're ready to commit to production quantities

<Warning>
**Prerequisites**

Before converting, all three materials (Leather, Accessories, Lining) must be in **Approved** status. The conversion button won't appear until this requirement is met.
</Warning>

## Conversion Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the approved sample">
    Go to **Samples** and open the sample you want to convert. Verify it shows all materials as Approved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Convert to Production">
    Find the **Convert to Production** button in the sample header or actions menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter production details">
    Fill in the production order information:
    - **Production Quantity** – How many units to manufacture
    - **Delivery Date** – Customer's required date
    - **PO Number** – Customer's purchase order reference
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm conversion">
    Review the details and click **Confirm**. The production order is created immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Carries Over

The following data transfers from sample to production order:

| Data | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Sample details | Description, style, customer |
| Material specs | All three material configurations |
| Labor rates | Stitcher rate and fuser rate |
| Files | Worksheets, images, and documents |
| Landed cost data | Base pricing information |

<Info>
You don't need to re-enter material specifications or rates. Everything from the approved sample flows into the production order.
</Info>

## What You'll Set New

Some details are specific to the production order:

- Production quantity (usually higher than sample quantity)
- Delivery date
- Customer PO number
- Size breakdown (if applicable)
- Color variants (if applicable)

## What Happens to the Sample

After conversion:

| Sample Change | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Status | Marked as **Converted** |
| Link | Shows link to the new production order |
| Editable | Sample becomes read-only |
| Visibility | Remains in system for reference |

The sample isn't deleted—it stays in your records as the source of the production order. You can always refer back to it.

<Tip>
Keep samples as a historical record. If you need to make a revised sample later, create a new one (e.g., `BOO-TOTE-002`) rather than editing the converted sample.
</Tip>

## After Conversion

Once converted, head to the production order to:

1. [Create job cards](/production/job-cards) for factory floor tracking
2. [Assign workers](/production/worker-assignment) to tasks
3. [Manage rates](/production/rate-management) if adjustments are needed
