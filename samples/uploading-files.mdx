## File Versioning

When you upload a new version of an existing file, the system tracks versions automatically.

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Latest** | This is the current version |
| **Previous** | An older version, kept for reference |

<Info>
Only the **Latest** version is shown by default. Toggle "Show all versions" to see the full history.
</Info>

### Uploading a New Version

1. Go to the file you want to update
2. Click **Upload New Version**
3. Select the updated file
4. The new file becomes the **Latest** version

The previous version is archived automatically—nothing is deleted.

## Supported File Types

| Category | Common formats |
|----------|----------------|
| Worksheets | PDF, XLSX, XLS, DOCX, DOC |
| Images | PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF |
| Comments | PDF, DOCX, TXT |

</Warning>

## Auto PO Detection

<Tip>
**Smart PO Upload**

When you upload a file to the **Purchase Orders** category, the system can automatically detect and link it to the relevant material based on the supplier name or PO number in the filename.

For example: `Leather_PO_12345.pdf` will suggest linking to the Leather material.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use clear file names">
    Name files descriptively: `BOO-TOTE-001_TechPack_v2.pdf` is better than `Document1.pdf`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep versions organized">
    Always use the version upload feature rather than uploading separate files like `file_v1`, `file_v2`, `file_final`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add descriptions">
    Include a brief description when uploading. Future you will thank present you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the right category">
    Don't put everything in "Comments". Use the correct category so files are easy to find.
