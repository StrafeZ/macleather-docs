# Creating a New Sample

When a customer requests a new product or you're developing a new design, create a sample to track its development from concept to approval.

## Steps to Create

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Samples">
    Navigate to **Samples** from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New Sample">
    Click the **New Sample** button in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the details">
    Enter the sample information:
    - **Sample Code** - Unique identifier for this sample
    - **Customer** - Select the customer requesting the sample
    - **Description** - Brief description of the product
    - **Quantity** - Number of sample units to produce
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the sample.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**What happens next?**

When you save a new sample, the system automatically creates three material entries:
- **Leather** - Main outer material
- **Accessories** - Hardware, zips, buckles, etc.
- **Lining** - Interior material

Each starts with status "Not Ordered" and can be tracked independently.

## Required Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Sample Code | Unique identifier | `BOO-BAG-001` |
| Customer | Who requested this sample | Boohoo |
| Description | What the product is | Black crossbody bag |
| Quantity | How many to make | 2 |

## Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Style Number | Customer's style reference |
| Season | Target season (SS25, AW25, etc.) |
| Notes | Internal comments |
| Stitcher Rate | Labor rate for stitching (PKR) |
| Fuser Rate | Labor rate for fusing (PKR) |

<Tip>
**Naming Convention**

Use a consistent format for sample codes: `CUSTOMER-STYLE-VERSION`

Examples:
- `BOO-TOTE-001` - First Boohoo tote sample
- `ASOS-BELT-003` - Third revision of ASOS belt
- `NEXT-WAL-002` - Second Next wallet version

This makes samples easy to find and track across revisions.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't save sample - missing fields">
    **Cause:** Required fields not completed.

    **Solution:** Check Sample Code, Customer, Description, and Quantity are all filled in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate sample code error">
    **Cause:** Sample code already exists.

    **Solution:** Use a unique code. Add version number (e.g., BOO-BAG-001 → BOO-BAG-002).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer not in dropdown">
    **Cause:** Customer not added to system.

    **Solution:** Contact admin to add the customer first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Materials not created automatically">
    **Cause:** System delay or error.

    **Solution:** Refresh page. If still missing, contact admin.
  </Accordion>
