<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't add items to shipment">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generate button not working">
    **Cause:** Missing required information (items, cartons, or customer details).

    1. Check Items tab has items added
    2. Check Cartons tab has cartons planned
    3. Verify customer information is complete
