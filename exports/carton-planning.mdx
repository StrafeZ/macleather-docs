## Efficiency Percentage

Efficiency shows how well carton space is being used.

### How It's Calculated

```
Efficiency = (Volume of Items ÷ Carton Volume) × 100
```

### Efficiency Indicators

| Percentage | Color | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 90%+ | Green | Excellent - well packed |
| 70-89% | Yellow | Acceptable |
| Below 70% | Red | Poor - wasted space |

### Overall Shipment Efficiency

Displayed at top of Cartons tab:

```
Overall Efficiency = Average efficiency of all cartons
```

<Info>
**Target: 90% or higher**

Higher efficiency means:
- Lower shipping costs (fewer cartons)
- Better protection (less movement inside)
- More professional presentation
</Info>

### Improving Efficiency

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Low efficiency (large carton, few items) | Use smaller carton |
| Can't fit more items | Items may be bulky - check dimensions |
| Many partially-filled cartons | Consolidate items into fewer cartons |

---

## Weight Limits

### Setting Weight Limits

When creating a carton, enter the **Max Weight** field.

### Weight Warnings

| Warning | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Yellow | Approaching weight limit (80%+) |
| Red | Over weight limit |

<Warning>
Do not exceed weight limits. Overweight cartons may be rejected by carriers or incur surcharges.
</Warning>

### Checking Carton Weight

Each carton displays:
- **Current Weight**: Sum of item weights
- **Max Weight**: Weight limit set
- **Remaining**: How much more can be added
